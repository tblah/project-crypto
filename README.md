[The documentation generated by cargo-doc](https://tblah.github.io/project-crypto/)

Building (you may need to install libsodium):
```
cargo build
```

Testing:
```
cargo test
```

To generate your own documentation:

```
cargo doc 
```

The main gotcha (so far) is to remember to call [sodiumoxide::init](https://dnaq.github.io/sodiumoxide/sodiumoxide/fn.init.html).
